            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>To start off, I created a simplistic design, consisting of a base, and an arm. The base would contain the motor, while the arm would contain the candy. A servo hole was created in the arm but was not used<p>
            <p>The design was created in tinkercad and was printed in green PLA @ 20% infill</p>
            <p>And yes, I did hand drill the holes since I forgot to cad them in</p>

            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>To address the issue of the mechanism tipping over, the base was significantly widened.</p>
            <p>It was also at this point I realized that I needed a slip ring. The servo wires would need a mechanism to be able to rotate since they are on a rotating mechanism that goes past 360 degrees. To do this, I designed a slip ring mount that attaches to the base.</p>
            <p>The design was created in tinkercad and was printed in grey PLA @ 20% infill</p>

            <h2>Issues</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Although the mechanism does not tip over anymore, it still moves around. This is not ideal for something that will sit on a table (in most scenarios).</p></li>
                <li><p>The slip ring mount is not the strongest, and can break eventually. This should be printed out of PETG, ABS, or PC in the future.</p></li>
                <li><p>This time too, I did not put holes on the CAD (for the slip ring holder) This is because I was still deciding which slip ring to buy. The generic $10 slip rings can handle 300 rpm, but the ~$50 slip rings can handle 1000 rpm. This is an important factor since the device should be able to launch a candy with some speed.</p></o></li>

                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p>Before CV is implemented to automatically launch candy at targets, the launching system should be perfected. To do this, the first thing needed is to design a servo horn that can knock the candy out. Relying on friction to hold the candy it is not ideal as it is unrealiable and does not give precision with the release angle. Through mutliple iterations, a design was reached.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the encoders were implemented to increase the accuracy of the launch angle. Please read more about this in <a href = "programming.html">programming section</a></p>
